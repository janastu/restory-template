Create a restory from available media resources on the web.
A set of HTML templates are avialable for a narrator to author his story.
To author a story:

You can create your own Annotations or Sweets, log in to
http://restory.swtr.us/
load any image or website from the internet to Annotate. 
Then you can use your annotations and Sweets to create a Restory. 

Step 1: Prepare Markup - An Author can choose to use the available HTML
templates, narrative-theme1.html or narrative-theme2.html or can use a own
theme. 


Step 2: To embed Media from a Sweet Store - 
Part I: Choose the Sweets you need to embed in your markup -
Visit the App http://restory.swtr.us/#/linked-data to browse the Sweets or image
annotations from the Sweet Store http://thestore.swtr.in
Make a note of the Sweet ID, of the annotation you want to embed in the markup.
see below screenshot.
[[img/swt-id.png]]
Create a html div with ID="Swt-id" of your annotation.

Part II:  
we pass the Json arguments to the function call like, 
{el: "#story-content",  --> the html element inside which the sweets needs to
be loaded
  "who":"scribe",  --> User name for the Sweets
  "what":"img-anno", --> Type of annotation
   "tag": "lolcat"},  --> tags
Input the Sweet store URL in js/chapters.js line # 18,

 
Step 3: Preview your HTML page on you local webserver to make sure the Sweets
are embedded in the page. 

Step 4: - Publish the HTML on internet.
