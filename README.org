A set of HTML templates are avialable for a narrator to author his story.


You can create your own Annotations or Sweets, log in to

load any image or website from the internet to Annotate. 
Then you can use your annotations and Sweets to create a Restory. 
To start with you can Restory with the Current available annotations at

Create a html div with ID="Swt-id" of your annotation.

Part II:  
we pass the Json arguments to the function call like, 
{el: "#story-content",  --> the html element inside which the sweets needs to
be loaded
  "who":"scribe",  --> User name for the Sweets
  "what":"img-anno", --> Type of annotation
   "tag": "lolcat"},  --> tags
Input the Sweet store URL in js/chapters.js line # 18,

 
Step 3: Preview your HTML page on you local webserver to make sure the Sweets
are embedded in the page.
